ACE2 human and ACE2 mouse
The alignment score: 3579    The percentage of identical amino acids:82.1%
ACE2 mouse and ACE2 cat:
The alignment score: 3592    The percentage of identical amino acid: 81.7%
ACE2 cat and ACE2 human
The alignment score: 3717    The percentage of identical amino acid: 85.2%


The interpretation
The sequences of cats and mice are most closely related. The percentages of
identical amino acid in three pairs are over 80%. Therefore, the ACE2 protein in three
species might be similar in structure and function.
